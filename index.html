</h1>
<p id="description" class="center">
    The Surprise Funeral Fund is a fund for surprise funerals to let your loved ones know that your other dear loved ones passed away, by invading their personal space and having the funeral in their living room. We'll even make your deceased family member into ashes. This is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing Surprise Funerals to the masses. We believe that everyone needs a more fun funeral! Donate now to support future surprise funerals everywhere!
